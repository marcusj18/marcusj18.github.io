            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>For the most part it is the very similar to the app that you would see on your phone but there are some big differences </p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>You can't find the instagram story bar and you can't view live videos. You can usually browse other live videos but you can't do this on your mobile brower. Also you can't view Saved pictures, pictures of you and you can't scroll though your pictures like you can on the app</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>Aside from the things I mentioned above you can basically do everything else.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>The bottom navigation bar is not well placed as it is next to my safari navigation so sometimes it opens a new tab when I don't want it to.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>Nothing works better than compared to the app or online</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I learned about what these websites cut when using there mobile versions. I learned that even sometimes they cut some features so they aren't even availiable to me. I learned that their apps just work so much better and that using the mobile browser is just very restrictive</p>
            
            
            <h2>Site</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
