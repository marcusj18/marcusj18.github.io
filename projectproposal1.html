                <h1>Purpose</h1>
                <p>The purpose of my site will be to provide important information to tennis coaches or players but will for the most part be directed at coaches. This information will be tips when teaching new students strokes as well as providing information to in match tips and doubles and singles strategy. </p>

                <h1>Content Pages</h1>
                <h4>Page One</h4>
                    <p>This first page is to give tips and teaching on Forehand and Backhand two vital parts of any players game. This will inculde information about teaching beginners and the steps you take. Also inculded will be correcting common mistakes for players that already have an idea about how to hit. Final information will be drills you can run for yourself or players to improve these parts</p>
                <h4>Page Two</h4>
                    <p>This page will be very similar to the first page but will focus on Serves and Volleys also very vital parts of a players tennis game (in all honestly I could write a page on each individual but there are other things i want to focus on to). Will follow Teaching beginners and correcting mistakes for people that are already familiar. Also making sure to have drills for these to.</p>
                <h4>Page Three</h4>
                    <p>This page will focus on what a coach can do on the sidelines when they have a player struggling in a match. Being able to talk to players and figuring out how to beat your opponent is a very cruical part of tennis. Sometimes it is difficult for coaches to be able to give constructive feedback to players other than "you are hitting the ball out". This page will help Coaches identify what needs correcting and what they should practice and what they should be saying to there players.</p>
                <h4>Page Four</h4>
                    <p>This page will work with strategy for singles. In addition to things that you can do in match to win points but will follow drills specfic to singles and combos you can practice to beef up your singles game. </p>
                <h4>Page five</h4>
                <p>Along the same lines of page four this will follow strategy but for doubles play. This page will most likely be more intensive as there is alot more strategy in doubles compared to singles in my opinion but i'm sure ill find more information with reseach.</p>
